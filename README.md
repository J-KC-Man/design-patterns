# design-patterns
Code implementations of design patterns from the book, "Head First Design Patterns" by Kathy Sierra and Elisabeth Freeman, first published in 2004

Viewing Java implementations:

If using Intellij IDEA, you need to:

1. Add the path to your Java SDK
2. Mark the src directory as Source Root by right clicking on the src folder -> mark as -> Sources Root
3. Specify the location of the 'out' folder by Pressing  Ctrl+Alt+Shift+S. The location should be in the same directory that the src directory is located in. eg <filepath>/<projectname>/out
